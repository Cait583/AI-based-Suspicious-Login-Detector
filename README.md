# AI-based-Suspicious-Login-Detector
🧠 Suspicious Login Detector (AI-Inspired Cybersecurity Tool)
🔍 Overview
This project simulates an AI-powered cybersecurity system that detects suspicious login attempts based on location, time, and other metadata. While not a full AI, this project mimics the approach of building one, using Python logic and (optionally) lightweight machine learning to evaluate login data.

Goal: Demonstrate an understanding of cybersecurity patterns and AI-style logic, even with limited resources.

⚙️ Features
Parses login data from CSV files (real or simulated).

Flags logins based on time, country, or IP rules.

Outputs flagged attempts in a clean report format.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas (for data processing)

Scikit-learn (optional ML module)

Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
